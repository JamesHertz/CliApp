# Simple CLI parser

This is a simple parser/library/framework to be used in interactive programs that requires constant user input (just like a shell).
There are things like [spring-shell](https://spring.io/projects/spring-shell) that does a great job, but I wanted to do something much more simpler and that better fits my needs.

My ultimate plan is to use this to finish the developmenet of [Grades-Manager](https://github.com/JamesHertz/Grades-Manager).
